I used the Kaggle global power plants dataset ( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramjasmaurya/global-powerplants )
and focused on the Canadian Power Plants Data.

I've included my Power BI report with a live map of the plants by capacity and primary fuel,
as well as a Python matplotlib bar plot of the top 10 power plants by capacity in MW
( 1 megawatt (MW) of solar panels will generate 2,146 megawatt hours (MWh) of solar energy per year )

The Power BI report is included but can also be viewed here:
